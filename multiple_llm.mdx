# Unlock the Power of Choice with Multiple LLMs on dume.ai

AI is no longer one-size-fits-all. With **dume.ai**, you can access and use **multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)**, such as GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and more—all from a single platform. This guide walks you through why multi-model support matters, how to use it, and how to pick the right LLM for your task.

## Why Use Multiple LLMs?

Each LLM has its own strengths:

- **GPT-4** excels at code, reasoning, and general language understanding.
- **Gemini** handles search-informed answers and Google integrations well.
- **DeepSeek** is best for math-heavy, research-based outputs.

With dume.ai, you’re not locked into just one. You can **mix and match LLMs**, or even use them **in parallel** for different parts of the same task.
