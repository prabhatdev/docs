The **Template Node** allows you to create **dynamic, formatted content** in your Dume AI workflow. By combining static text with variables and outputs from earlier nodes, you can generate personalized emails, reports, summaries, and more—automatically and at scale.

## Key Functions

- **Dynamic Text Generation:** Insert data from previous workflow steps into custom text templates.
- **Versatile Output:** Create human-readable emails, multi-section reports, notifications, or formatted API payloads.
- **Automation Ready:** Chain with LLM nodes, inputs, code, or API calls for fully automated document creation.

## How It Works

- **Content Field:** Write your template using freeform text. Type **"/"** to reference and insert any output from previous nodes—turning workflow data into a polished document.
- **Variable Substitution:** As the workflow runs, placeholders are replaced with actual values from your process.
- **No-Code Setup:** Simple interface means you don’t need advanced coding experience.

## Example Use Cases

- **Email Generation:**\
  Example template:
- 
- `# Hi {INPUT/user_name},  Your support request (ID: {INPUT/ticket_id}) has been {LLM_Node/status_update}.  Regards,   The Support Team `
- **Report Creation:**\
  Example template:
- `# Weekly Sales Report for {INPUT/report_date}  Total Sales: {HTTP_SALES_NODE/total_sales} Top Product: {HTTP_SALES_NODE/top_product} Comments: {LLM_NODE/summary} `
- **Notifications:**\
  Example template:

  `Task "{INPUT/task_name}" assigned to {INPUT/assignee} is due on {INPUT/due_date}. `

## User Interface Overview

- **Description Area:** Summarize the template’s purpose and data sources for team clarity.
- **Content Editor:** Type or paste your formatted template. Reference data with **"/"** to see a list of available variables.
- **Variable List:** Track which data points are used, ensuring completeness.
- **Next Node:** Pass the generated document to output, send via email, or push to another service.

## Best Practices

- **Preview your content** before deployment to verify all variables resolve properly.
- **Name your variables clearly** in earlier nodes for easy reference.
- **Chain Template Nodes** for layered document building (e.g., one for headers, one for detailed tables).
- **Document the template’s logic** in the node’s description so your team can collaborate confidently.

The **Template Node** is the finishing touch that brings together data and narrative—transforming automated data flows into professional, ready-to-use documents, notifications, or communications.
