## Input Node:

The **Input Node** is the foundation of any workflow in Dume AI. It lets you define all the dynamic fields that a user must provide when triggering a workflow — such as the topic of a post, type of audience, desired tone, and more.

## Configuration Options

Each input field added to this node supports, for exmaple:

| Field           | Description                      | Type   | Required? |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| `post_topic`    | The main subject of the content  | string | ✅         |
| `goal`          | Purpose of the post              | select | ✅         |
| `audience_type` | Who you’re targeting             | select | ✅         |
| `tone`          | Desired tone (e.g., formal, fun) | select | ✅         |

## Visual Reference

/>

This is how the Input Node appears when added to your workflow. Each field is marked as **Required** and type-labeled (e.g., `string`, `select`) for easy validation.

## Field Types Supported

- `string` – Plain text input.
- `number` – Numeric input.
- `boolean` – True/False switches.
- `select` – Dropdown menu with predefined values.
- `object` – JSON-like structure for complex data (advanced).
- `array` – Lists of items (coming soon).

## Practical Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Social Media Post Generator" icon="sparkles">
    | Field           | Value                   |
    | :-------------- | :---------------------- |
    | `post_topic`    | “AI Tools for Founders” |
    | `goal`          | “Engagement”            |
    | `audience_type` | “Startup Founders”      |
    | `tone`          | “Professional”          |

    Use these values to generate a LinkedIn post with an engaging hook, body, and CTA.

  <Card title="Ad Copy Generator" icon="sparkles">
    | Field           | Value                        |
    | :-------------- | :--------------------------- |
    | `post_topic`    | “Productivity App for Teams” |
    | `goal`          | “Lead Generation”            |
    | `audience_type` | “Remote Managers”            |
    | `tone`          | “Energetic”                  |

    Feed this input into LLM and Template nodes to generate ad titles, descriptions, and call-to-actions.

## How It Works With Other Nodes

- Refer to inputs in **LLM Nodes** using `/post_topic`, `/goal`, etc.
- Use inputs in **Condition Nodes** for branching logic.
- Populate **Templates** dynamically with user data.

## Best Practices

- **Mark all essential fields as required** to avoid runtime errors.
- `Use select for controlled vocabularies` (like tone or goal).
- **Avoid using long, ambiguous string fields** when options can be structured.
- **Test with different combinations of inputs** to ensure downstream nodes handle variability.
