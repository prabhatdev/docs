The **Note Node** in Dume AI workflows is a dedicated annotation tool that allows you to add **rich, markdown-supported documentation** directly within your automation UI. Its purpose is to improve workflow clarity, onboard new collaborators faster, and serve as an in-context reference for usage or logic explanations.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Documentation:** The Note Node cannot be connected to workflow logic. It exists solely for information and does not affect data flow or execution.
- **Markdown Support:** Write formatted explanations with headers, lists, code, links, and highlights using standard Markdown. This enables you to create visually clear guides and structured documentation right inside your workflow editor.
- **Workflow Readability:** Place Note Nodes next to complex logic or entry points to provide immediate, contextual help for yourself or your team.
- **Guided Onboarding:** Share ‚Äúwhat this workflow does,‚Äù step-by-step usage instructions, define required/optional fields, or outline the overall workflow process‚Äîall in a single, easily readable panel.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Workflow Introduction:** Present at the top of a flow to outline the solution‚Äôs purpose and high-level summary.
- **Usage Instructions:** Share clear, easy-to-follow guidelines about the required and optional inputs with examples, as shown in the attached images.
- **Process Documentation:** Break down logic, stage explanations, and what each part of the workflow accomplishes.
- **Team Communication:** Leave reminders, notes, or best practices for current and future collaborators.

## Example

Here‚Äôs how a Note Node might be used to document a Story Generator workflow:

```` # üìñ Story Generator Workflow  ## ‚ú® What this workflow does This workflow creates **complete stories** with rich characters, detailed worlds, and engaging plots.  ## üéØ How to use   1. **Run this workflow** from chat   2. **Provide required inputs:**      - genre: fantasy, romance, mystery, sci-fi, thriller, adventure    - length: short, medium, long   3. **Optional inputs:**      - character_count: Number for detailed character development    - setting: Custom setting (e.g., "Space station") ```  As depicted in the screenshots, the Note Node clearly separates **required** and **optional** inputs, outlines the *workflow process*, and adds visual structure for team readability.  ## Best Practices  - Use consistent structure: start with a purpose, then document usage and process. - Make use of Markdown headers, lists, and highlights for easy scanning. - Update the Note Node when your workflow changes to keep documentation current.  The **Note Node** is essential for maintainable, collaborative, and scalable workflow design‚Äîensuring everyone understands not just *how* the automation is built, but *why*.  : [Screenshot-2025-07-22-at-1.18.12-AM.jpg] : [Screenshot-2025-07-22-at-1.19.20-AM.jpg] ````
