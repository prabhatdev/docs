# Access Real-Time Data with Dume AI's Web Search

Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools trained on massive datasets, but they are fundamentally limited by the cutoff date of their training data. This means any event, update, or change that occurs after that date is outside the model's knowledge.

Dume AI addresses this limitation by offering **built-in web search** capabilities. With this feature, Dume can search the internet for the most current information and respond with up-to-date, relevant insights—directly within your workflow.

## Static Models vs. Real-Time Intelligence

Most LLMs operate with a fixed knowledge base. For instance, if a model was trained on data only up to mid-2024, it cannot provide insights on events or content from 2025 unless updated. This creates a significant gap, especially for tasks that depend on the latest developments.

With Dume AI, that gap is bridged. You no longer need to switch between tabs or manually verify facts—Dume performs the search for you and provides an intelligent response grounded in current web content.

## How Web Search Works in Dume

The process is seamless and requires no configuration. Here's how it works:

1. **User Input**: You ask a question or make a request that may require recent data.
2. **Trigger Detection**: Dume detects if the query needs real-time context.
3. **Web Search**: It performs a web search in the background.
4. **Contextual Response**: Dume reads and summarizes relevant pages, then replies with a contextual answer.

## Example Use Cases

Some scenarios where Dume’s web search feature adds critical value:

- **News and Events**: “What happened at the Apple keynote this week?”
- **Product Research**: “Compare the latest AI writing tools launched in 2025.”
- **Market Intelligence**: “Has OpenAI released a new model this month?”
- **Pricing Data**: “What’s the gold prices for last month in USA?”

In each case, Dume searches live data sources and responds with actionable answers.

## Seamless Integration with Your Tools

Web search doesn’t exist in isolation. Dume is already connected to tools like Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion, and Slack. The ability to pull real-time data complements these integrations.

For example, while writing an email in Gmail, you might ask Dume:

> “Can you search for the latest case study published by [Company Name]?”

Dume will fetch, read, and summarize the results, and you can directly add that information to your email draft.

## How to Use This Feature

To make use of Dume’s web search:

- Simply type a natural question.
- If the question requires up-to-date content, Dume initiates a web search automatically.
- You’ll receive a summarized, focused response.
- You can also ask follow-up questions based on the same context.

No additional settings, plugins, or toggles required.
