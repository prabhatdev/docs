## What is MCP server?

An MCP server implements the Model Context Protocol, acting as a middleware that offers tools, data, and prompts to AI models via a standardized interface. It handles context management, tool discovery, and state persistence—enabling AI agents to connect seamlessly with external systems and maintain multi‑turn interactions.
